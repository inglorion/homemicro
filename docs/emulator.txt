#+TITLE: The Emulator

The Home Micro source code repository contains an emulator that can be
used to run programs and firmware written for the Home Micro on other
computers. The source code for the emulator is in the emulator
directory of the repository.

To start the emulator, a ROM image file named rom.bin must be present
in the directory the emulator is run from. In addition, to load a
program, a file named cartridge.bin must be present in the same
directory.

The following commands, starting from the top of the Home Micro source
repository, will create a ROM image and a cartridge image and place
both in the emulator directory. The emulator will also be built and
invoked. The require that all the necessary software dependencies are
present on the system. For more information on those, see
[[file:requirements.txt]].
