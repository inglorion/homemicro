Two-wire interface.

The Home Micro uses a two-wire interface to communicate with
cartridges. The same bus can also be used to communicate with
peripherals. The protocol used on this bus is a limited form of I2C,
where:

1. Arbitrage is not supported. The computer is always bus master.

2. Clock stretching is not supported. Only the computer can drive the
SCL line.

In general, a device that supports I2C fast mode, does not attempt to
become bus master, and does not stretch the clock should be compatible
with the Home Micro's TWI.

The protocol has the following timing and electrical specifications.
These are believed to be compatible with I2C at 400kHz fast mode. In
some cases, the Home Micro TWI protocol provides for longer timings
than I2C requires, allowing devices more time to respond.
