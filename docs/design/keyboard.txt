* Ghosting

The rows are selected by the byte written to the keyboard row
register, and the columns are read when the keyboard column register
is read.

Ghosting occurs when two keys in row x are pressed together with a
key in a different column but in the same row as one of the keys.
If we call the pressed keys (x, a) and (x, b), the other key (y, a),
then scanning column y will show (y, b) as pressed, regardless of
whether it actually is or not.

0. Keys that can ghost without harm:
 - LSH+RSH
 - LCTL+RCTL
 - LE+RI
 - UP+DN

1. Keys where ghosting is Mostly Harmless:
 - BS+RET
 - BS+alphanumeric
 - BS+arrow
 - ESC+RET
 - RET+alphanumeric
 - RET+arrow

2. Combinations for which ghosting is acceptable:

3. Combinations for which ghosting is undesirable:
 - A+S
 - A+W
 - D+S
 - D+W
 - I+J
 - I+K
 - J+M
 - K+M
 - ESC+any key
 - CTL+SH+any key
 - 
4. Combinations which may not ghost:
 - SH+any key
 - CTL+any key
 - DN+LE
 - DN+RI
 - UP+LE
 - UP+RI

* Electrical Interface

The rows are connected so that they are either high impedance or 0.
The columns are connected through 100K ohm pull-up resistors.
When a key is pressed when its row its active, it drives its column
low. Columns in which no key is pressed (on the active row) are 1.

* Parts

 - 1x 8-bit flip-flop for the rows. 74HC574.
 - 1x 8-bit buffer for the columns. 74HCT245.
 - 8 diodes. 1N4148 works fine.
 - 8 resistors. 100K ohm was used for testing.

Clock the flip-flop when its address is selected and w# is low.
and clock (nor w# sel#).

Buffer output is enabled when its address is selected and oe# is low.
or oe# sel#.

This allows for a relatively simple to build keyboard. Alternatively,
the same interface can be implemented by a microcontroller, which can
then speak a different protocol to the actual keyboard; for example,
the PS/2 keyboard protocol.


* Programming Interface

2 memory locations. CPU writes column number to one, reads row from
other.

Between the write and the read, at least 4 CPU cycles need to
elapse. That equates to 16 memory cycles and 32 master clock cycles.
This should be ample time for a microcontroller to read and write
a value, leaving cycles to interact with the actual keyboard.
