Home Micro 1000
---------------

The Home Micro 1000 video circuitry is greatly simplified from that of
the Home Micro 2000 and provides only a single video mode: 320x200
pixels in a single color. As with the Home Micro 2000, the video is
output as a VGA signal.


Home Micro 2000
---------------

The Home Micro 2000 was designed to generate a VGA signal with up to
16 colors. VGA was chosen because it is relatively easy to generate,
easy to add color to, and can be displayed on modern displays either
natively or with commonly availabe adapters.

The video the Home Micro 2000 generates consists of 320 pixels
horizontally and 200 vertically, for a total of 64,000 pixels. To
allow every pixel to be individually set to one of the 16 colors would
require 4 bits per pixel, for a total of 32,000 bytes, just under half
the addressable memory. Instead of sacrificing that much address
space, the Home Micro offers a number of different video modes that
offer more compact, albeit also less flexible encodings:

320x200 graphics with 2 screen colors
320x200 2-color graphics with 8x8 color tiles
160x200 4-color graphics with 4 screen colors
160x200 4-color graphics with 8x8 color tiles (2 tile colors, 2 screen colors)
320x200 text mode with 2 screen colors
320x200 2-color text mode with 8x8 color tiles
160x200 4-color text mode with 4 screen colors
160x200 4-color text mode with 8x8 color tiles (2 tile colors, 2 screen colors)

The bus arbiter provides 4 cycles. One of these is used by the CPU,
leaving 3 for video.

In character mode, the first cycle is used to fetch the character.
This uses bits 13..3 from the video address generator as bits 10..0 of
the video address (providing for 1K addresses).

When color tiles are enabled, the second cycle is used to fetch the colors.
This uses bits 13..3 as 10..0, again providing for 1K addresses.

In color character mode, the second cycle is used to fetch the first half
of the character data.

The third cycle is used to fetch pixel data. In graphics mode, this
uses bits 13..0. In character mode, this uses the text from cycle 1 as bits
10..3 and bits 2..0 of the video address as bits 2..0.

Bit 15 is always 1, and bit 14 is equal to the alternate graphics bit.
