<h1>Evolution of a 16-Color Palette</h1>
<p>The goal was to create a palette for an 8-bit home computer.
The palette has 16 colors, which keeps memory requirements reasonable
and is in line with what many home computers offered,
as well as PCs until the arrival of VGA.
Because the idea is to build a computer that can render the palette by hand,
a simple circuit should be able to generate the colors in the palette.</p>

<h2>Saturated RGBI</h2>

<p>The original idea was an RGBI palette, where red, green, and blue
each get one bit to indicate whether the primary is present in the
color, and there is one bit that controls brightness. These colors can
be generated with 4 resistors and 3 diodes - each color channel gets a
resistor that translates the logic level to the signal for the bright
color, and a resistor and a diode that pull the signal level down when
the intensity bit is off. A similar palette is used by the ZX
Spectrum. The images resulting from this palette are shown in the top
row below. All colors are very saturated.</p>

<h2>Less Saturated RGBI</h2>

</div>

<p>Another way to implement brightness is to, instead of making R, G,
and B brighter if they are already present in the color, add some
value to all of them for the bright colors. In a sense, this generates
bright colors from dark colors by mixing in some white. This is the
approach CGA and EGA use. The second row of images shows what this
looks like. The implementation is similar to the fully saturated
colors and likewise uses 4 resistors and 3 diodes, but the diodes
point the other way.</p>

<h2>Simple Support for Brown</h2>

<div>
<img src="rgbi1.png" width="256" height="64" />
</div>

<p>The major drawback of both basic RGBI schemes is that there is no
brown. Dark red can be used instead, but that means brown and dark red
cannot occur in the same image. CGA and EGA contain circuitry that
convert dark yellow into brown by halving the green signal. This looks
much more visually pleasing, but at the expense of the additional
circuitry that matches just one specific color. As an alternative, I
tried a scheme where the green signal is always reduced, but part of
the blue channel is added to green. This moves dark yellow more
towards brown, without affecting bright yellow as much, because bright
colors are less saturated. Compared to the basic RGBI implementations,
this requires an additional resistor and diode - not too bad a
cost. This is the first palette that I was pretty happy with. It is
shown in the third row in the image.</p>

<h2>Better Skin Tones</h2>

<div>
<img src="rgbi2.png" width="256" height="64" />
</div>

<p>After converting many images to the palette and being happy with
most of the results, I took a look at what my palette did poorly. One
thing I was particularly unhappy with was skin tones. They would
contain too much red, basically making everyone look sunburned. This is
actually a problem with many existing 16-color palettes, but I
wondered if I could do better. I tried reducing green some more and
adding some of the red channel to the green signal. This improved skin
tones, at the expense of adding yet another resistor and diode. The
result can be seen in the fourth row in the image.</p>

<h2>Darker Brown</h2>

<div>

</div>

<p>Looking at the images after the skin tone improvement, I wasn't
quite happy with how bright the brown color was. I decided to try
something different. Instead of mixing red into green, I just reduced
the intensity of red, green, and blue, making dark colors darker and
bright colors less saturated. This approach takes 4 resistors and 4
diodes and so is actually cheaper to implement than better skin
tones. I think the skin tones still look acceptable, but brown is now
darker. The result is shown in the fifth row in the image.</p>

are EGA, and the last one is Commodore 64 (which has a very different
palette, not based on RGBI at all).</p>
