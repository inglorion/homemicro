#+TITLE: Programming the ROM

To build the Home Micro ROM, from the top of the repository:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
homemicro$ cd rom
rom$ make
#+END_SRC

This will create ~rom.bin~.

If you are using the [[file:design/rom-programmer.txt][ROM Programmer circuit]]
with a Raspberry Pi, you can use the writerom tool to write the ROM
image to the ROM chip.

First, the writerom tool has to be built (this only needs to be done
once - and, of course, if you make changes to the writerom tool).
Again starting from the top of the repository (use ~cd ..~ first if
you are in the ROM directory):

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
homemicro$ cd tools
tools$ make
#+END_SRC

To write the ROM image using the writerom tool (from the rom directory):

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
rom$ sudo ../tools/memory/writerom rom.bin 0 8192
#+END_SRC

The numbers here indicate the start position and the size of the ROM
image, respectively.
