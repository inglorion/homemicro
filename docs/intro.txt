Home Micro provides a series of microcomputers that can be built by
hand using electronics parts that are currently in
production. Parts lists, assembly instructions, design notes, software
tools, an emulator, and full source code are provided, as well as a
number of sample applications.

Home Micro was inspired by late 1970s and early 1980s home computers
such as the Apple II, Atari 8-bit series, Commodore 64, ZX80 and ZX
Spectrum. With relatively modest hardware capabilities and cost, these
computers allowed generations of enthusiasts to create some very
impressive software. Home Micro enables the construction of a computer
with roughly similar capabilities from parts that are currently being
manufactured and sold.
